# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Current changes should be added to unreleased. After the milestone (in our case it would be weekly meetings), the unreleased changes are moved to their respective version section. The version is written as `week # (YYYY-MM-DD)`. The changelog contains the following sections:

- BREAKING CHANGES
- FEATURES
- IMPROVEMENTS
- BUG FIXES
- RISKS AND LIMITATIONS

Example of the version section:

```
## Week 1 (2022-10-27)

### BREAKING CHANGES
- breaking change one
- breaking change two

### FEATURES
- feature one
- feature two

### BUG FIXES
- bug fix one
```

If there is no changes in a dedicated section, the section is omitted.
